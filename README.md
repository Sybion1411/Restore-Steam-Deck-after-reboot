# Restore-Steam-Deck-after-reboot
This is the private setting of the Steam Deck. I don't want to mess in the file system, so I used some workarounds. That's why it's a public repository - hope that you can find something usefull :)

## 0. Prepare the reboot

You will need 1/2 of an hour to prepare the reboot.

### 0.1. Do pictures

I know - it's unprofessional, but I'm amator and I don't shame on it. Maybe some day I could create script that backup everything before the reboot. So, I need a pictures of:

- [PL] tacka systemowa i jej ustawienia
- system settings
- Brave (open sites)
- Dolphine (open folders, placec and [PL] ustawienia paska narzędzi)
- Start Menu
- Apps installed in Dicovery [Flatpak] ([PL] zwłaszcza tych, których ikony nie są widoczne w systemie)
- Decky Loader (plugins [PL] zwłaszcza ukrytych and their settings, like CSS)

### 0.2. Copy files to the external driver

- Export of the Brave's bookmarks
- Download folder
- Documents folder
- Steam Games folder ([PL] źródło)
- Game Saves folder ([PL] źródło)
- Applications folder (for Citra emulation)
- Emulation folder ([PL] źródło)

### 0.3. Reboot system

In the Gaming GUI go to the Setting and [PL] Przywróć ustawienia fabryczne

---

## 1. After the reboot

You will need [PL] w chuj to prepare that part
